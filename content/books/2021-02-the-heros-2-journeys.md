I learn about this book in on Russel Brunson's experts secrets books. He talked about how this workshop taught him how to tell not just good by great stories. After listening to this book, I can clearly see why.

In this book, the authors talk about what makes a story interesting. They say that almost every movies in Hollywood has a hero who follows a outer journey that is readily visible by users. The outer journey almost consist of a goal someone want to achieve.

But in addition to the outer goal, a hero also have a more private, inner journey that is only revealed to the users at the end of the movie. The inner journey consist of the transformation the hero undergo while following his outer journey.

Although the outer journey is important to get people to follow the story, the inner journey is what truly matters and makes a story great.

After listening to this book, I feel like I have gained additional knowledge on how to tell stories. And when I watch an Hollywood movie, I can almost see exactly what the authors have said about how story are structured. This will help become great at telling stories about myself, my business ventures and products.
