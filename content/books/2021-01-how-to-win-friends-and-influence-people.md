After reading this book, I realized that sometimes we only think about ourselves and not others. We rarely think about how our actions influence others. We want people to do what we want without understanding their fears and desires.

I am normally someone who likes to argue a lot, always trying to win an argument. But this book made me realize that nobody really wins an argument. It's really difficult to change other people opinions by telling them they are wrong, by judging them.

After reading this book, I decided to try to avoid arguing with others, to make an effort to actively listen to others, to care about their desires, their needs and want, to remember their names and something about them, to really care about others.

I decided to reduce my complaints against people around me but instead start being more positive, grateful and start noticing things they do well or are great at.

This book made me realize that I should always make an effort to consider the human inside every people I meet or do business with.
