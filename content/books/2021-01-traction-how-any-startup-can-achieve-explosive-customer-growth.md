By reading this book, I discovered 19 acquisition channels I can use to acquire customers for my book or business. Prior to reading this book, I relied almost entirely on social media marketing. But this book did a good job of calling me out on my own biaises against all the other channels.

The framework, bullseyes, presented in this book is a good technique for testing the waters with the other channels I didn't know or didn't even think about.

I don't think most of the channels presented in this book will be useful in developing countries but I am willing to give it a try.

Nevertheless, I am sold on using Bullseye going forward as my framework for testing and choosing traction channels and strategies for my business ventures.
