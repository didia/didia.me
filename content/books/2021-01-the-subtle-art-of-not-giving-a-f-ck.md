I must admit, when I saw the title of this book, I was immediately turned off. How could someone possibly think it is a good thing to not give a fuck about others ?

For a kid who grew up in Africa, in a christian family in addition, I could not accept it. I have been taught to care about others, to give a fuck about my faith, to give a fuck about my actions, to give a fuck!

But, I decided to read the book anyway because many friends recommended it to me. And after reading the first two chapters only, I must say, I realized it wasn't entirely what I thought it to be. This book definitely surprised me in a positive way.

In this book, the author advances that what make people unhappy is not the fact that bad things happen to them or others, it is the fact that we constantly worry about those bad things. What affects us the most is that constant worry about things that we have no control over. We end up in a cycle of worrying. 

The author calls this cycle the **Feedback Loop from Hell**. We worry about something then we worry about the fact that we are worried about that thing. We get angry at ourselves for that then we worry about the fact that we got angry. It goes on and on and on.

The author proposes that we exercise greater influence about what we choose to worry about. The book does not say we should not give a fuck about everything. Ultimately, we must all give a fuck about something. The book says that we should choose what we decide to give a fuck about. It is normal that bad things happen to us or others, it is okay that problems occur sometimes. Happiness comes from solving problems not from the inexistence of problems.

So, how do we decide what to worry about ? Most of the time, the answer lies in our values system. It depends on what we value. Changing our values, how we define failure or success for us will greatly influence what we give a fuck about. If we measure ourselves against the success of others, then we will have no other options to care about what they do. The author calls this problem the **Rockstar problem.**

The exemple of rockstar Dave Mustaine is what caught my attention the most in this book. How can someone who achieved so much success still considers himself a failure ? The answer to that is so simple. The man just could not appreciate his success because his former brand, Metallica, from which he was thrown out went on to achieve even more success. The fact that he cared so much about proving them that they made a mistake by letting him go prevented him from finding happiness in his own successes.

I cannot count the number of times I have found myself in that position growing up. And today, with social media, it is even worse. You go to a great vacation, you are happy. You log in to Facebook, you see your friend went to an even better place than you. Suddenly, your mood changes. You become unable to enjoy what you were enjoying just some minutes ago. You start seeing all the bad things about that place. You are not happy anymore. Why ? It's called envy i.e giving a fuck about what others have that you don't.

After reading this book, I told myself I should get my value straight! Give up comparison to others and only compare myself to me. I will now choose consciously what I want to give a fuck about. I will try to only give a fuck about things I can do something about. Things that are directly in my circle of influence. I will embrace failure. I will accept the fact that the world is fucked up! I will avoid feeling sorry about myself, letting problems and challenges make me unhappy. I will get out of the Feedback Loop from Hell for good!
