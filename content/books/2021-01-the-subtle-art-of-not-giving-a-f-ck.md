I must admit, when I saw the title of this book, I was immediately turned off. How could someone possibly think it is a good think to not give a fuck about others ?

For a kid who grew up in Africa, in a christian family in addition, I could not accept it. I have been thought to care about others, to give a fuck about my faith, to give a fuck about my actions, to give a fuck!

But, I ended up picking up the book because many of my friends recommended it to me. And after reading the first two chapters only, I must say, I realized it wasn't entirely what I thought it to be. This book definitely surprised me positively.

In this book, the author advances that what make people unhappy is not the fact that bad things happen to them or others, it is the fact that we constantly worry about those bad things. It is that constant worry about things that we have no control that affect us the most. We end up in a cycle of worrying. 

The author calls this cycle the **Feedback Loop from Hell**. We worry about something then we worry about the fact that we are worried about something. We get angry at ourselves for that then we worry about the fact that we are angry and it goes on and on.

The author proposes that we exercise greater influence about what we chose to worry about. The book does not say we should not give a fuck about everything. It says we should choose what we decide to give a fuck about. It is okay that bad things happen to us, it is okay that problem occurs. Happiness comes from solving problems not from the inexistence of problems.

How do we chose what to worry about ? Most of the time, the answer lies in our value system. It depends on what we value. Changing our values, how we define failure or success for us will greatly influence what we give a fuck about. If we measure ourselves against the success of others, then we will have no other options to care about what they do. The author calls this problem the **Rockstar problem.**

The exemple of rockstar Dave Mustaine is what caught me the most in this book. That exemple shows how someone who went on to be one of the most successful rockstar in the world could not appreciate his success because his former brand, Metallica, which fired him had gone on to achieve even greater success. He could not be happy and considered himself a failure because he didn't do better that Metallica.
