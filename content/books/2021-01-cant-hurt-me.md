After reading this book, I did not have any more reason to feel weak again. What the author went through in his live to become what he became showed me that you can achieve whatever you want as long as you don't let your mind and body trick you into thinking you are incapable.

This book allowed me to challenge myself physically. I started running in the winter for the first time. Every time, I would feel like I cannot do something or I am incapable of doing something, I remind myself of David Goggins and realize with training and hard work, I can achieve anything.

Every time, I think that I have reached my limit, I remind myself of the 40% rule that says that most of us only tap into 40 % of our capabilities. After learning about the 40% rule, I felt I didn't have any excuses to surpass myself and reach for the sky.

In this book, David also talks about how motivation is overrated. Motivation is what get us going. But to achieve big thing, to achieve results we have to become obsessed. I did not particularly agree with the obsession part but I realized that discipline is the key. I can get motivated to start something but I need discipline to stay the course.
