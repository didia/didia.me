  Cybersecutiry is becoming so important today that we cannot continue to put
  security as an after-thought or leaving security to specific security team or
  squad. I believe it is time for software developer as all, just like we
  embrace devops, to embrace a security-first mindset.

Imagine everybody in your city waking up to a notification saying you have been targetted by a nuclear bomb, you should evacuate as soon as possible. Imagine the chaos that will ensue while everybody is trying to escape... What if I told you, it was just a hoax by some kid still living with his parents? You wouldn't be happy, would you?

Welp, this is the sort of things that can happen when a software system is not secure. Someone can misuse it in the worst possible way and cause chaos or even death to others.\
Hacking has always been an issue since computer systems came into the existence. But in this internet of things age, it has now gotten both accessible and extremely dangerous. Developing a system without security or privacy in mind can expose people to dangers. Just look at [this website of unsecured cameras connected to the internet around the world](https://www.insecam.org/en/bycountry/CA/) to see the extent of it. These are things that should not exist in today's world.

So who is to blame for this ?
