  After struggling to keep the learning on, I decided to take matters into my
  hands and ask people with more experience to teach how they were able to do
  it.

\- The new opportunity

The first people I reached out to were colleagues who had more experience than I and who had a family to attend to. I asked them how they found time to keep learning while maintaining a great work-life balance. Most of them told me that they faced the same issue. They wanted to keep learning on their own time but found it impossible. Some told me it should be expected of them to spend their home time to keep learning for work, it was immoral. Still, some did find time to do it, albeit an insignificant time. But for most experienced people I talked to, I learned that they did most if not all of their learning at work on company time.

That last insight is what surprised me the most. How do you learn on company time ? Well, I know most employers provide formation budgets but they rarely give employees time needed to use those budgets. So employees end up needing to use their own time for the formation. But these people were telling me they were learning on company time. How were they doing it ?  We are usually so busy at work that taking time to learn instead of working on our deliverables is almost never an option. So do you take time at work to work on
