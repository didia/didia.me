  How do you find time to keep getting better at your job while still giving
  enough quality time to your friends and family ? That was the question I asked
  experienced people around me. The answers I got were both insightful and
  unexpected. They shaped my approach to learning at work. And that's what I am
  going to share with you in this article.

This is the second article of the series [**How to keep learning while working**](/category/how-to-keep-learning-while-working/) in which I share how I learned to find the time, energy and focus necessary to learn new things while maintaining a good work-life balance.

Previous article ☞ [**How to keep learning while working, Part 1: it's hard when you have a life**](/how-to-keep-learning-while-working/its-hard-when-you-have-a-life)

After the birth of my son, it became increasingly difficult for me to find time to keep learning outside of work. I put to rest all my side projects. I stopped taking online classes and basically for the next three months or so that followed, I didn’t learn anything new outside of work.

This made me fear that my career was stalling while I still had so much room to grow! Of course, I couldn't let that happen! Fortunately, I knew a lot of people who seemed to have successful careers and successful families. I told myself if they could do it, I could do it. I just needed to find out how they were doing it. So I reached out to them to find out.

The question I asked all of them was something like this: How do you find time to keep getting better at your job while still giving enough quality time to your family and friends ?

I got many different answers. You could easily see that everybody had their own approaches. But upon reviewing all the answers, I was able to group them into 3 main categories:

1. The learning by experience folks.
2. The actively learning on the job horde.
3. The "I learn on my own time" tribe.

The answers I got could be grouped into 3 main categories:

\- They let experience teach them new things\

* Some people learn actively on the job\
* Some learn by themselves using their own time.

The first people I reached out to were colleagues who had more experience than I and who had a family to attend to. I asked them how they found time to keep learning while maintaining a great work-life balance. Most of them told me that they faced the same issue. They wanted to keep learning on their own time but found it impossible. Some told me it should be expected of them to spend their home time to keep learning for work, it was immoral. Still, some did find time to do it, albeit an insignificant time. But for most experienced people I talked to, I learned that they did most if not all of their learning at work on company time.

That last insight is what surprised me the most. How do you learn on company time ? Well, I know most employers provide formation budgets but they rarely give employees time needed to use those budgets. So employees end up needing to use their own time for the formation. But these people were telling me they were learning on company time. How were they doing it ?  We are usually so busy at work that taking time to learn instead of working on our deliverables is almost never an option. So do you take time at work to work on
