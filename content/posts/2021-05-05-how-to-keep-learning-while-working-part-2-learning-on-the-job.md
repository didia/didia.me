  How do you find time to keep getting better at your job while still giving
  enough quality time to your friends and family ? That was the question I asked
  experienced people around me. The answers I got were both insightful and
  unexpected. They shaped my approach to learning at work. And that's what I am
  going to share with you in this article.

This is the second article of the series [**How to keep learning while working**](/category/how-to-keep-learning-while-working/) in which I share how I learned to find the time, energy and focus necessary to learn new things while maintaining a good work-life balance.

Previous article ☞ [**How to keep learning while working, Part 1: it's hard when you have a life**](/how-to-keep-learning-while-working/its-hard-when-you-have-a-life)

After the birth of my son, it became increasingly difficult for me to find time to keep learning outside of work. I put to rest all my side projects. I stopped taking online classes. Basically, I didn't learn anything new outside of work for the next three months or so that followed. I was afraid that my career was stalling while I still had so much room to grow! I couldn't let that happen! 

Fortunately, I knew a lot of people who seemed to have both successful careers and successful families. I thought if they could do it, why shouldn't I ? I just needed to find out how. So I went and asked them.

My question was something like this: How do you find time to keep getting better at your job while still giving enough quality time to your family and friends ?

Almost everyone I talked to had his own approach to the problem. But I was able to group all those different approaches into three main insights:

1. Learn on my own time
2. Learn by experience
3. Learn proactively on company time

## Learning by experience

Learning by experience was the preferred way for most people I talked to. I could easily see why. This is probably the default way all of us learn on the job because we don't have to do anything to make it happen. In fact, as the great Julius Cesar once said, «Ut est rerum omnium magister usus» which translates to "experience is the best teacher". 

But is learning by experience enough by itself ?

In my opinion, I don't think so. Learning by experience can be exceptionally great when working in a fast paced environnement where the type of problems you work on changes very often. But for most people who work in a steady environment, the learning by experience process can be very slow.

Even when I was not able to find time to learn after work anymore, I was still learning by experience while doing my job. But it was not enough. I wasn't satisfied with it because it depended a lot on what I was working on at the moment. When I was working on something new, a new technology or a new framework, I was learning a lot. But it was not the case when I was just applying what I already knew.

But the biggest problem for me with the learning by experience approach is the feeling that I am in a passive mode. It put me in a situation when I am not in control of what I learn. I am only learning when faced with problems I don't know how to solve already. I am not learning to avoid potential problems nor to innovate.

As we can see, learning by experience alone was not enough for me. I needed an approach that would allow me to keep learning more than what is required to do my job.

## Learning on my own time

Some people I talked to used their own time after work to learn more and acquire new skills about their job. Most of people in this category had either grown kids or no kids at all! But there were still some who were able to do it while having small kids (mostly a single child).

When I asked the latter how they did it, most told me they made time after their kids have gone to bed or early in the morning. I wanted to ask what about spending time with your partner but I didn't. I felt it was too private to ask.

Those answers didn't quite satisfy me because that was the struggle I was in. Even if I could manage to find time after my child and wife are sleeping, it wouldn't be enough to cover the amount of learning I used to do. So I needed to find something else.

## Learning proactively on the job

People in this category told me that they learn proactively on their job. They didn't way for problems to happen to learn how to solve them. They anticipated problems. They kept sync with what was happening in their field, the innovation and tried to bring it back to their job to make things better.

Most of the people in this category had some kind of incentive to do it! Either they held positions in their company that allowed them some flexibility to do that or the company gave them time and learning budget to encourage learning.

Choosing learning by experience as the only way to learn on the job is probably the best option for most people how have a life because in most case it does not require more than what we are already asked to do in our job description.

However, the drawback with this option is it doesn't allow us to

People in this category told me that they do most of the learning on the job while working on their projects. When they face new problems, they learn how to solve them. That's how they get better at their jobs.

Everybody I talked to listed learning by experience as one of the way they kept learning on the job. And the majority of people listed this method as the only way. This should not be surprising to anyone because as Julius Cesar once said, _Ut est rerum omnium magister usus, _which means experience is the best teacher.

The answers I got could be grouped into 3 main categories:

\- They let experience teach them new things\

* Some people learn actively on the job\
* Some learn by themselves using their own time.

The first people I reached out to were colleagues who had more experience than I and who had a family to attend to. I asked them how they found time to keep learning while maintaining a great work-life balance. Most of them told me that they faced the same issue. They wanted to keep learning on their own time but found it impossible. Some told me it should be expected of them to spend their home time to keep learning for work, it was immoral. Still, some did find time to do it, albeit an insignificant time. But for most experienced people I talked to, I learned that they did most if not all of their learning at work on company time.

That last insight is what surprised me the most. How do you learn on company time ? Well, I know most employers provide formation budgets but they rarely give employees time needed to use those budgets. So employees end up needing to use their own time for the formation. But these people were telling me they were learning on company time. How were they doing it ?  We are usually so busy at work that taking time to learn instead of working on our deliverables is almost never an option. So do you take time at work to work on
