  After struggling to keep learning new things while working, I went around and
  asked colleagues who seemed to have both successful careers and successful
  families. The answers I got were both insightful and unexpected. They shaped
  my approach to learning at work. And that's what I am sharing in this article.

This is the second article of the series [**How to keep learning while working**](/category/how-to-keep-learning-while-working/) in which I share how I learned to find the time, energy and focus necessary to learn new things while maintaining a good work-life balance.

Previous article â˜ž [**How to keep learning while working, Part 1: it's hard when you have a life**](/how-to-keep-learning-while-working/its-hard-when-you-have-a-life)

As I said in the previous articles, the many changes that happened in my life made it more and more difficult for me to keep learning. But I was not going to accept that status quo because I believed my career still had so much room to grow. To solve this problem, I went around and asked colleagues who seemed to have both successful careers and successful families. I wanted to know how they did so I could be inspired to the same.

The answers I got could be grouped into 3 main categories:

\- They let experience teach them new things\
- Some people learn actively on the job\
- Some learn by themselves using their own time.

The first people I reached out to were colleagues who had more experience than I and who had a family to attend to. I asked them how they found time to keep learning while maintaining a great work-life balance. Most of them told me that they faced the same issue. They wanted to keep learning on their own time but found it impossible. Some told me it should be expected of them to spend their home time to keep learning for work, it was immoral. Still, some did find time to do it, albeit an insignificant time. But for most experienced people I talked to, I learned that they did most if not all of their learning at work on company time.

That last insight is what surprised me the most. How do you learn on company time ? Well, I know most employers provide formation budgets but they rarely give employees time needed to use those budgets. So employees end up needing to use their own time for the formation. But these people were telling me they were learning on company time. How were they doing it ?  We are usually so busy at work that taking time to learn instead of working on our deliverables is almost never an option. So do you take time at work to work on
