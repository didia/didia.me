  How do you find time to keep getting better at your job while still giving
  enough quality time to your friends and family ? That was the question I asked
  experienced people around me. The answers I got were both insightful and
  unexpected. They shaped my approach to learning at work. And that's what I am
  going to share with you in this article.

This is the second article of the series [**How to keep learning while working**](/category/how-to-keep-learning-while-working/) in which I share how I learned to find the time, energy and focus necessary to learn new things while maintaining a good work-life balance.

Previous article ☞ [**How to keep learning while working, Part 1: it's hard when you have a life**](/how-to-keep-learning-while-working/its-hard-when-you-have-a-life)

After the birth of my son, it became increasingly difficult for me to find time to keep learning outside of work. I put to rest all my side projects. I stopped taking online classes. Basically, I didn't learn anything new outside of work for the next three months or so that followed. I was afraid that my career was stalling while I still had so much room to grow! I couldn't let that happen! 

Fortunately, I knew a lot of people who seemed to have both successful careers and successful families. I thought if they could do it, why shouldn't I ? I just needed to find out how. So I went and asked them.

My question was something like this: How do you find time to keep getting better at your job while still giving enough quality time to your family and friends ?

Almost everyone I talked to had his own approach to the problem. But I was able to group all those different approaches into three group:

1. Learn by experience
2. Learn on my own time
3. Learn proactively on company time

## Learning by experience

Learning by experience was the preferred way for most people I talked to. I could easily see why. This is probably the default way all of us learn on the job because we don't have to do anything to make it happen. In fact, as the great Julius Cesar once said, «Ut est rerum omnium magister usus» which translates to "experience is the best teacher". 

But is learning by experience enough by itself ?

In my opinion, I don't think so. Learning by experience can be exceptionally great when working in a fast paced environnement where the type of problems you work on changes very often. But for most people who work in a steady environment, the learning by experience process can be very slow.

Even when I was not able to find time to learn after work anymore, I was still learning by experience while doing my job. But it was not enough. I wasn't satisfied with it because it depended a lot on what I was working on at the moment. When I was working on something new, a new technology or a new framework, I was learning a lot. But it was not the case when I was just applying what I already knew.

But the biggest problem for me with the learning by experience approach is the feeling that I am in a passive mode. It put me in a situation when I am not in control of what I learn. I am only learning when faced with problems I don't know how to solve already. I am not learning to avoid potential problems nor to innovate.

As we can see, learning by experience alone was not enough for me. I needed an approach that would allow me to keep learning more than what is required to do my job.

## Learning on my own time

Some people I talked to were able to find outside of work to keep learning. When I asked them how they did it, most told me they used the time after their kids have gone to bed or early in the morning.

Unfortunately, that answer was not that useful to me because it was exactly what I was struggling with. I did not see how I could possibly make it work. With my family in the mix, my schedule was already packed.

I wake up my day at 5 a.m. From 5 a.m to 6 a.m, I go through the waking up routine, meditation and some stretching exercices to get my day going. From 6 a.m to 6 p.m, it's a 12h work timespan: 8h on my regular job, one hour exercising and the rest on my passion project.

When I am done working at 6 p.m, I try to spend the next 3 hours on supper and playing with my kid. Beside getting him to daycare, that's almost the only time I spend with him on weekdays. After he goes to bed, I try to spend 9 p.m to 10 p.m with my wife as much as I can. 10 p.m to 10:30 pm is planning time for the next day. And at 11 p.m, the day is over. I go to bed and hit restart the next morning at 5 a.m.

I have to admit that writing the last two paragraphs made my life feel very boring. But they pretty sum up why I was not able to find time to learn outside of work on weekdays. When it comes to weekends, my wife once scolded me because I was spending as much time working on weekdays than on weekends. Since then, I try to dedicate my weekends to spending as much time as I can playing with my kid.

One thing that also surprised me a lot was some people who used this approach to advance their company projects were resentful of their employer for that. It was like they felt their employer exploited them and didn't recognize enough the extra time they were putting in.  It was a very surprising to me because it was not their employers who asked them to do it in the first place.

All this and my crazy schedule convinced me that this was not the right approach for me. I was just unable to see how I could possibly find time outside of work to learn without impacting negatively the already limited time I was spending with my family. I needed to find something else.

## Learning proactively on company time

What if we could make learning by experience more active than passive ? What if instead of just solving problems when they occur, we could use some company time to learn how to prevent them from occurring ?  What if rather than just doing the job we are expected to do, we could use some company time to learn how to make what we are working on better ?

This proactive learning approach was used by some people I talked in order to keep learning on their job. They were using company time not only to do the job at hands but also to learn about how their industry was evolving in order to innovate on their job.

When I was first told about this approach, I felt stupid. Why didn't I think about this in the first place ? Why was I not using this approach ? It seemed like the most logical think to do, right ? But after putting some thoughts on it, I was not so sure anymore.

For starter, I already had a lot on my plate at my job and things kept being added to the backlog. How could I possibly use company time to learn new things when I already felt like the 40 hours per week I was doing were not even enough to do what had yet to be done ?

Most people I talked to were able to do it because the roles they had gave them freedom to do it! When you are working in a research & development(R&D) context, it is part of your job to learn new things. But for those of us who work in a service context, it is not obvious. When clients come to us with projects to realize, it is usually because they believe we know how to do it. They are not paying us to learn how to do it. This makes using their time to learn 

Although learning proactively on company time seemed like the perfect option for me, I could not see how I could justify using the

After digging deeper, I realized that most people

People in this category told me that they learn proactively on their job. They didn't way for problems to happen to learn how to solve them. They anticipated problems. They kept sync with what was happening in their field, the innovation and tried to bring it back to their job to make things better.

Most of the people in this category had some kind of incentive to do it! Either they held positions in their company that allowed them some flexibility to do that or the company gave them time and learning budget to encourage learning.

Choosing learning by experience as the only way to learn on the job is probably the best option for most people how have a life because in most case it does not require more than what we are already asked to do in our job description.

However, the drawback with this option is it doesn't allow us to

People in this category told me that they do most of the learning on the job while working on their projects. When they face new problems, they learn how to solve them. That's how they get better at their jobs.

Everybody I talked to listed learning by experience as one of the way they kept learning on the job. And the majority of people listed this method as the only way. This should not be surprising to anyone because as Julius Cesar once said, _Ut est rerum omnium magister usus, _which means experience is the best teacher.

The answers I got could be grouped into 3 main categories:

\- They let experience teach them new things\

* Some people learn actively on the job\
* Some learn by themselves using their own time.

The first people I reached out to were colleagues who had more experience than I and who had a family to attend to. I asked them how they found time to keep learning while maintaining a great work-life balance. Most of them told me that they faced the same issue. They wanted to keep learning on their own time but found it impossible. Some told me it should be expected of them to spend their home time to keep learning for work, it was immoral. Still, some did find time to do it, albeit an insignificant time. But for most experienced people I talked to, I learned that they did most if not all of their learning at work on company time.

That last insight is what surprised me the most. How do you learn on company time ? Well, I know most employers provide formation budgets but they rarely give employees time needed to use those budgets. So employees end up needing to use their own time for the formation. But these people were telling me they were learning on company time. How were they doing it ?  We are usually so busy at work that taking time to learn instead of working on our deliverables is almost never an option. So do you take time at work to work on
