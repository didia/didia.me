  How do you find time to keep getting better at your job while still giving
  enough quality time to your friends and family ? That was the question I asked
  experienced people around me. The answers I got were both insightful and
  unexpected. They shaped my approach to learning at work. And that's what I am
  going to share with you in this article.

This is the second article of the series [**How to keep learning while working**](/category/how-to-keep-learning-while-working/) in which I share how I learned to find the time, energy and focus necessary to learn new things while maintaining a good work-life balance.

Previous article ☞ [**How to keep learning while working, Part 1: it's hard when you have a life**](/how-to-keep-learning-while-working/its-hard-when-you-have-a-life)

After the birth of my son, it became increasingly difficult for me to find time to keep learning outside of work. I put all my side projects to rest. I stopped taking online classes. Basically, I didn't learn anything new outside of work for the next three months or so that followed. I was afraid that my career was stalling when I still had so much room to grow! I couldn't let that happen! 

Fortunately, I knew a lot of people who seemed to have both successful careers and successful families. I thought if they could do it, why shouldn't I ? I just needed to find out how. So I went and asked them.

My question was something like this: How do you find time to keep getting better at your job while still spending quality time with your friends and families ?

Almost everyone I talked to had his own approach to the problem. But by talking to them, I was able to regroup all those approaches into three options:

1. Learn by experience
2. Learn on my own time
3. Learn proactively on company time

## Learning by experience

Learning by experience was the preferred way for most people I talked to and I could easily see why. It's the default way we learn on the job and we don't even have to do anything to make it happen. It's a natural process. In fact, as the great Julius Cesar once said, «Ut est rerum omnium magister usus» which translates to "experience is the best teacher". 

Learning by experience is great because it happens naturally on the job. It doesn't require us to spend any additional time or effort outside of what is already required by our job. It can be exceptionally great when working in a fast paced environnement were the type of problems we work on changes very often. Unfortunately, that's not always the case for everybody.

In fact, when working in a steady environnement, learning by experience can be very slow and limited. And  it also depends a lot on the job we are doing at the moment. For me personally, even when I was not able to find time to learn after work anymore, I was still able to learn by experience when doing my job. But it was not enough because I was learning only when working on something new, a new technology or a new framework which does not happen very often. Most of the time, I was just applying what I already knew.

Another problem I had with only learning by experience was the feeling that I was not in control of what I was learning. I was not innovating anymore. I was only learning when faced with problems I didn't already know how to solve.

All these problems convinced me that learning by experience alone wasn't enough for me. I need an approach that would me to keep learning more than just what is required to the job.

## Learning on my own time

Some people I talked to were able to find time outside of work to keep learning. When I asked them how they did it, most told me they used the time after their kids have gone to bed or early in the morning.

Unfortunately, that answer was not very useful to me because it was exactly what I was already struggling with. I did not see how I could possibly make it work with already packed schedule.

In fact, I start my day at 5 a.m. From 5 a.m to 6 a.m, I go through my waking up routine which includes some meditation and stretching exercices to get my day going. 6 a.m to 6 p.m, is my 12h work timespan: 8h on my regular job, one hour exercising and the rest on my passion project.

After I am done working at 6 p.m, I try to spend the next 3 hours playing with my kid. Beside getting him to daycare, that's the only time I spend with him on weekdays. So, those 3 hours are sacred. After he goes to bed, I try to spend 9 p.m to 10 p.m with my wife as much as I can. 10 p.m to 10:30 pm is planning time for the next day. And at 11 p.m, the day is over. I go to bed and hit restart the next morning at 5 a.m.

I have to admit that these last two paragraphs make my life feel very boring. But they pretty much sum up why I was not able to find time to learn outside of work on weekdays. But what about the weekends ? 

Well, when it comes to weekends, I had another big challenge. My wife was not really happy that I was spending as much time working on weekdays than on weekends and she scolded me for it. Since then, I try to make sure my weekends are as light on work as possible. On Saturday, I can spend a couple of hours working on my passion project while my kid is still sleeping but on Sunday, it is down right prohibited. I don't do anything remotely related to work unless I am on-call. Sunday is really off-limit.

All this convinced me that learning on my own time at home would be difficult to pull off. I could not see how I could possibly find time outside of work without impacting negatively the already limited time I was spending with my family. In addition to my lack of time problem, I observed something else that made me even wary of using this approach.

In fact, when talking to people who were using their own time to learn things or work on side-projects that were directly benefiting their employers, I remarked that they usually were resentful of their employer.  It seemed like they felt exploited and didn't receive enough recognition for the extra effort they were putting in. This was very surprising to me because in almost every case, it was not the employers who asked them to work on their own time. So why were they resentful if they chose to do it themselves ?

Well, I couldn't find out. But what I did know was that I needed another learning approach.

## Learning proactively on company time

What if we could make learning by experience more active than passive ? What if instead of just solving problems when they occur, we could use some company time to learn how to prevent them from occurring ?  What if rather than just doing the job, we could use some company time to learn how to do an even better job ?

Of all the learning approaches, learning proactively on company time was the only one I hadn't thought about. To me, this didn't really make sense. I mean, when employers or clients pay us, it's because they think we already know how to do the job, not to learn how to do it. I have always thought that I had to provide value for every penny I was being paid and learning was not providing value. So I was not confortable using company time to advance my self.

So, I was really surprised when I realized that some people I talked to were using just that: proactively learning on company time. How were they doing it ?

For starters, I realized that almost everybody who were using this approach felt into three categories:

1. **People whose jobs included learning**: Many people have learning new things included in their job description. For exemple, people who work in Research & Development (R&D) are expected to spend a big part of their company time learning new things. There are a lot people like that whose part of their jobs is to actively monitor what is going on in their field of expertise and bring it back to their employer.
2. **People whose companies have a learning time policy**: Some companies give their employees not only budgets but also time to learn new things. People in those companies can take time off their projects to learn new things which can be useful for the company.\
   What I found out by talking to people is companies giving just budget to encourage learning is not enough because employee still have to use their own time outside of work to learn. So those budgets end up unused most of the time. 
3. **People who just took time on their own**: Lastly, there were a few people who just took company time to learn on their own even if it was not included in their job description or it was not explicitly provided by the company. Most people in this category were working in a project with little to no stress that allowed them to do that. But still, there were others who were doing it because they felt it was their duty as professionals to do it.

## What would work best for me ?

After reviewing all the options above, I came into the realization that the first two approaches wouldn't really work for me.

On one hand, relying on experience only to get better at my job was already out of question because that's what prompted me to start looking for alternatives in the first place. Learning by experience alone slowed down my career and didn't allow me to stay ahead of the curve. So, I couldn't afford to settle for it.

On the other hand, I had already used the learning on my own time approach before the birth of my son. It worked really well for me and allowed me to learn a lot in the first few years of my career. But as I started building my family, I realized that I needed to sacrifice a lot my social life in order to find time to keep learning. That wasn't something I was eager to do.

So, the only remaining option for me was to learn proactively on company time. It would have allowed me to stay ahead of the curve without impacting the time I spent with friends and family. However, as I started thinking about how I would set it up, I found that there were two main obstacles that would prevent me to adopt this approach.

The first obstacle was the lack of a learning time policy or benefit at my company. Although we were provided with a generous learning budget, we weren't given the time necessary to spend that budget. (Disclaimer: This changed in January 2021 when we started receiving one full day per year to spend on learning)\
This meant that I needed to use my project time in order to keep learning which I wasn't very confortable with because it meant using project time on something that may not even be useful for my client or company. And even if I were confortable doing it, It would be hard to pull off because I couldn't afford downtime on the project I was working on.

The second obstacle was that my job didn't consist primarily of R&D. Although, we couldn't have time to work on proof of concept here and there, it was not something expected. Most of the time was spent on actually doing the work. I have to admit that the kind of work we do provided me with a lot of learning by experience opportunity and I am really grateful for that. However, it was primarily learning to solve problems we were facing, not learning to innovate. And I wasn't confortable using client money to learn or work on side projects that didn't bring him value at all.

In , I couldn't settle for learning by experience alone because it made me feel like my career was stalling. The passi

After digging deeper, I realized that most people

People in this category told me that they learn proactively on their job. They didn't way for problems to happen to learn how to solve them. They anticipated problems. They kept sync with what was happening in their field, the innovation and tried to bring it back to their job to make things better.

Most of the people in this category had some kind of incentive to do it! Either they held positions in their company that allowed them some flexibility to do that or the company gave them time and learning budget to encourage learning.

Choosing learning by experience as the only way to learn on the job is probably the best option for most people how have a life because in most case it does not require more than what we are already asked to do in our job description.

However, the drawback with this option is it doesn't allow us to

People in this category told me that they do most of the learning on the job while working on their projects. When they face new problems, they learn how to solve them. That's how they get better at their jobs.

Everybody I talked to listed learning by experience as one of the way they kept learning on the job. And the majority of people listed this method as the only way. This should not be surprising to anyone because as Julius Cesar once said, _Ut est rerum omnium magister usus, _which means experience is the best teacher.

The answers I got could be grouped into 3 main categories:

\- They let experience teach them new things\

* Some people learn actively on the job\
* Some learn by themselves using their own time.

The first people I reached out to were colleagues who had more experience than I and who had a family to attend to. I asked them how they found time to keep learning while maintaining a great work-life balance. Most of them told me that they faced the same issue. They wanted to keep learning on their own time but found it impossible. Some told me it should be expected of them to spend their home time to keep learning for work, it was immoral. Still, some did find time to do it, albeit an insignificant time. But for most experienced people I talked to, I learned that they did most if not all of their learning at work on company time.

That last insight is what surprised me the most. How do you learn on company time ? Well, I know most employers provide formation budgets but they rarely give employees time needed to use those budgets. So employees end up needing to use their own time for the formation. But these people were telling me they were learning on company time. How were they doing it ?  We are usually so busy at work that taking time to learn instead of working on our deliverables is almost never an option. So do you take time at work to work on
