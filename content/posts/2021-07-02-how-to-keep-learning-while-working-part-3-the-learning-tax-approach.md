This is the third article of the series **[How to keep learning while working](/category/how-to-keep-learning-while-working/)** in which I share how I learned to find the time, energy and focus necessary to learn new things while maintaining a good work-life balance.

Previous article â˜ž **[How to keep learning while working, Part 2: What experienced people taught me about learning on the job](/how-to-keep-learning-while-working/what-experienced-people-taught-me-about-learning-on-the-job)**

In late 2019, the project I was working on needed a new lead mobile developer as the previous one moved on to another project. At that point, the only experience I had as a mobile developer was a two months stint two years before. Nevertheless, I decided to take on the challenge as it was a really urgent need for our project. 

Although my company gave me enough time to onboard and get used to the technicalities of the project, I knew that they wouldn't have waited for me to become a good enough mobile developer before starting to contribute. We had urgent needs that couldn't wait for me.

Fortunately, my all around knowledge of software development helped me get up to speed faster. I wasn't yet a good mobile developer but I was already contributing to the project after a month or so.

But, I couldn't stop there. Being able to contribute was good but what I wanted was excellence. I needed to be not just a good developer but an excellent one. And to reach that level, I needed to keep learning while doing the job. This was the perfect opportunity to test my new learning tax approach I talked about at the end of the previous article.

## What is the learning tax approach ?

Learning on company time is for me the best approach to get better at one's job. The problem I had with that approach was that it could easily be abused or be seen as a theft by an employer. I have seen so many instances where someone on the team takes a lot of time on his own to learn something which wasn't even important for the project at hands. This would always draw frustration from the project manager and other team members because they viewed it as wasted time and budget. 

The learning tax approach aims to fix that by being a more restricted version of using company time to learn. Instead of just taking any amount of time to learn any subject, the employee should make sure that they only learn subjects that have a demonstrated potential to bring value to the company and they should also set a fixed amount of time per week that they would dedicate to learning.\
\
With these restrictions, the goal is to make sure that taking company time to learn is always a win-win for both the employee and the company.

These restrictions aim to make sure that taking company time to learn is always a win-win for both the employee and the employer. The employee get time to learn whatever she chooses as long as she can demonstrate how what she is learning can bring value to the employer down the road. This helps convince the employer that it's not wasted time but an investment for the future. And the fixed amount of time per week makes sure the time spent is predictable for the employer. 

## Using the learning tax approach ?

The learning tax approach involves using a percentage of company time for learning purposes. The amount of time is fixed to make it predictable and it should be used exclusively on learning subjects that may benefit the company down the road.

For me, the subject easily passed the criteria. I wanted to become an excellent mobile developer. This would definitely help the company or even the specific project I was working as I couldn't find solutions easier and faster thus saving them time and money. That part was evident. The only thing that remained was choosing the right percentage of company time to dedicate to learning.

Choosing an amount of time to charge as a learning tax to my employer wasn't an easy task. I had to make sure that the amount chosen would allow me to learn at a good pace without affecting my ability to deliver my project assignments on time.

To achieve that goal, I decided to go with the minimum amount time I could use for learning. Because I used the pomodoro technique for focus work, that amount was 25 minutes. So, I started by dedicating 25 minutes per day or roughly 2 hours per week. That was only 5% of my 40 hours work week which wasn't a lot.

But after just two weeks, it became evident that the 5% tax wasn't going to make it. I couldn't keep up the pace of my online classes. Two hours per week weren't going to be enough . I needed to take a much larger tax if I wanted to make this learning tax approach work. So, I decided to double the learning tax to two 25 minutes block per day instead of one.

After trying it for two weeks, I came to the conclusion that this 10% learning tax was what I wanted. It gave me 4 hours of learning per week without affecting how much work I was able to do in a week.

## Does the learning tax approach work ?

I have been using the learning tax approach since January 2020. Since then, it has helped me learn a lot about both engineering and management. I have used the tax to become a better mobile developer and hone my leadership skills.

Yes, I still have some difficulties to use the full 4 hours per week of learning, especially when I work on intensive tasks. But for the most part, I have been able to learn and grow more since adopting this strategy.

Using the learning tax approach doesn't seem to have affected my ability to be productive. In opposite, I think it has even increased my productivity as I have learned through the months how to be more effective and do more in less time.\
\
Even if I had to be questioned one day by my employer about the tax, I have made sure that whatever I choose to learn using this approach, I can demonstrate how it could help the company or the project I am working on down the road.

So far, I have used my learning tax in classes, articles, lessons about active listening, empathy, technical leadership, engineering management, Mobile app performance, etc. And I'm really satisfied with the growth I have gained through these classes.

I intend to keep using the learning tax approach to keep getting better at whatever job I'm doing. Today, my child being a little bit grown up, I also manage to use 25 minutes of personal time each morning to learn things that may not have a direct impact on my job. The combination of this and the learning tax approach has allowed me to reach a level of learning I'm really satisfied with. Now, I feel like I'm learning something new everyday and I'm enjoying it. And I can see the repercussion of all this both in my professional and personal life.

## Want to try the learning tax approach ?

If you are looking to learn proactively to get better at your job but find it difficult to learn on your personal time, I would suggest you to give this learning tax approach a try. It's really simple to set up and get going. You just need to chose two things:

1. How much time you'll dedicate to learning: Make sure you some fare amount. I would suggest choosing an amount that allows you to have a good pace without affecting your capacity to deliver. If you are having a hard time finding that out, try 10%.
2. What to learn: In order to make sure your employer doesn't see you taking time to learn in a wrong way, make sure to choose to learn something that have a direct impact on what you are doing now or will be doing in a near feature. And make sure what you will get from learning has the potential to bring a lot of value to your employer. This way, it will be easier for you to justify taking the time if you are asked to do it one day.
