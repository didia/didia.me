This is the third article of the series **[How to keep learning while working](/category/how-to-keep-learning-while-working/)** in which I share how I learned to find the time, energy and focus necessary to learn new things while maintaining a good work-life balance.

Previous article â˜ž **[How to keep learning while working, Part 2: What experienced people taught me about learning on the job](/how-to-keep-learning-while-working/what-experienced-people-taught-me-about-learning-on-the-job)**

After learning what more experienced people around me were doing to keep getting better at their job while still spending quality with their friends and family, I realized that none of the tactics they shared with me really fitted what I was looking for. I was gutted and decided to stick to learning entirely on my own time as I used to do even if that meant I needed to make some sacrifices on my work-life balance.

Then one day, I got an unsuspected idea while filing my taxes. We give the government part of our hard earned money to allow it to make our life better by building infrastructures and services that would benefit us and potentially help us make even more money.

As the government serves me, I serve my employer and its clients. What if my employer paid me a learning tax to better serve them just like I pay tax to the government for it to better serve me ? As an idea, this was really a stretch one. There is a big difference between my relation to the government and the one to my employer. But I liked the idea because it seemed to me like a better version of working on company time. So I decided to try it out.

## What is the learning tax approach ?

The learning tax approach is a more restricted version of the learning on company time approach that we saw in the previous article. In essence, they both implies using some amount of your work hours to learn. But, in opposite to the learning on company time approach, the learning tax approach restricts the amount of time one can use for learning and limits the learning contents to only those subjects which can bring value to the company. 

## Who is this approach for ?

The learning tax approach works well for people who are looking to learn proactively but find it difficult to learn on their personal time and their job contents rarely give them opportunities for proactive learning.

## How does it work ?

To implement the learning tax approach, you need to careful choose what you are going to learn and how much time you will spend on it.

### Choosing what to learn

The learning tax approach requires that the subjects learned have a potential to bring value to the company down the road. So when choosing what to learn, it is important to select only those subjects whose value can be demonstrated to the employer. This helps make taking time to learn a clear win-win situation for both the employer and the employee.

### Choosing how much time to spend on learning

This will depend on what you are learning, your employer and your work hours. The rule of thumb is it should be a reasonable amount that won't impede on your ability to deliver your assignments on time.

## How did I use the learning tax approach ?

In late 2019, there was a need for a mobile developer on our project as the one who did it before switched for another project. At that point, I had spent only two months as mobile developer and that was more than 2 years before. Nevertheless, I decided to make the switch from the web because it was an urgent need. there was an opening for a mobile development position in the project I was working on.

Although I was filled with good intentions, the mobile development side of the project was new to me. I needed to get up to speed by learning how the project was built and how mobile development had evolved since the last time I did it. As that was a part of the job content at that moment, I was able to use company time to learn as much as I could.

I started with an entire week of learning and then gradually started charging my clients for the value I was bringing. After a little more than two months, I reached the point where I knew everything I needed to know in order to do a decent job and deliver value for the project.

But I also knew that I hadn't yet become a very good mobile developer. I knew most of what needed to be done for the project but I still wouldn't call myself a real mobile developer. Some additional learnings had to be done to reach that point.

This opportunity coincided with the moment I was looking for a new learning approach. So I decided to use it to test my new learning tax approach.

### First ride with the learning tax approach

To start using this approach, I first needed to choose the learning tax that is how much time I would dedicate to learning per week. This time would be taken out of my 40 hours work-week. 

Deciding how long I would spend on learning was no easy task. I knew that If I wanted this approach to work, I needed to choose an amount that would allow me not only to learn consistently and at a good pace but also to keep delivering my project's tasks. Neither my project nor my teammates should feel a negative impact of my new unilaterally imposed learning tax.

To minimize impact on my team, I decided to go with 25 minutes of learning per day or roughly 2 hours per week. Why 25 minutes ? You may ask. Well, 25 minutes is the unit of focused time when using the pomodoro technique, a time management system I use for my focused work. So, choosing a single block of 25 minutes, also called a pomodoro, was choosing the minimum amount I could spend on learning.

Two weeks later, I realized it was a bad choice. A single pomodoro was not going to make it for me. The learning pace was too slow. It would take me forever to finish the Android development training offered by Google, the first training I decided to spend the tax on. I needed to increase my time commitment.

Instead of a pomodoro per day, I decided to try 3 pomodoro per day or a total of 8 hours and 20 minutes per week. This worked wonders. My learning pace increased, obviously. My interest in learning increased as well. It was like hitting the sweat spot. I could see the advancement. Spending 3 pomodoro per day made the learning continuous. I had enough time to finish most lessons. It was fun again. However, there was one big problem.

After just one week of 3 pomodoro per day, I knew it wouldn't work. 



So, for my first go at it, I decided to try 25 minutes of learning per day. Why 25 minutes ? Well, because 25 minutes is the smallest unit of focused time when using the pomodoro technique, a time management system I use to do focused work.

Just two weeks in, I realized that 25 minutes per day of learning wasn't going to make it. My learning pace was really slow, I wasn't advancing a lot and because of that, I was losing interest in learning altogether.

For my first try, I decided to go with 25 minutes per day for learning. I chose 25 minutes because it represent the smallest unit of focused time when using the pomodoro technique which I used for my focused work.

After two weeks, I quickly realized that 25 minutes weren't enough to learn. My learning pace was really slow and because I wasn't advancing a lot, I was losing interest in learning altogether. So, I decided to increase my learning tax to 50 minutes per day instead.

That increase had an immediate impact. Spending 50 minutes per day or 4 hours per week on learning really made a difference for me. I was able to use that time to follow most of my coursera online classes and still stay on schedule. The tax also allowed me to go through the advanced Android development training offered by Google. Now, I was feeling a lot more proactive, a feeling I had lost for so long. But the best part about all of it was that it didn't affect my ability to deliver on my projects one-bit. I cannot say exactly how much of an increase in productivity I saw but I felt like I was now delivering my tasks faster following the new knowledge I was now getting consistently.

### The danger of wanting more

50 minutes per day or 4 hours per week made a lot more sense. Yes, it was still less than what I used to spend on learning per week but I realized it was more than enough for me to maintain my learning targets. And I also realized that it didn't affect my capacity to deliver my tasks on time.

Because, I use the pomodoro technique for my work, I decided to go with the smallest unit of focused time possible, a single pomodori per day i.e 25 minutes. For two weeks that followed, I spent 25 minutes everyday going through the advanced Android development training offered by Google. \
To test the learning tax approach, I decided to first go with a 25 minutes per day learning tax. I used that time to go through the advanced Android development training developed by Google.

After two weeks, I realized that 25 minutes was not enough. My learning pace was really slow

\
Despite my will to help, the mobile side of the project was still new to me. To be able to contribute, I needed to learn how everything worked and how mobile development was done at Mirego. For that, I used company time to learn as this was an integral part of my job content. In less than 2 months, I was already able to contribue to the project. The learning was fast, fun, exciting and was all done on company time.

Although I had reached the point where I could use 100% percent of my time to deliver value to the client, I knew deep down that it was impossible to become a good mobile developer in 2 months. What I had become was a good mobile contributor for the project. I could deliver great value but I knew that I needed to learn more to become a better mobile developer. I knew that when faced with a slightly more difficult problem than what I have had to face so far, I would have struggled.

To keep learning to become a better mobile developer, I had two choices: Either, I cthe slow process of learning by exp

 I was already contributing to the project. not only about the project but also about how mobile development was done at Mirego.Because this was all new to me, I needed a little bit of onboarding and learning before I could be able to contribute. As this was part of my job content,  \

I decided to start testing the learning tax approach in late 2019. It was the perfect timing for it because right around the same time, I also started doing mobile application development, something I hadn't really done a lot in the past. So, I needed to learn how mobile development how mobile development was done at Mirego and because this was an existing project, I also needed to learn how it was built in the first place. This was what was required for me to be able to work on the project. And because it was required and part of the job, I did it on company time without any problem.

Indeed, this allowed me to start contributing to the project. But I knew deep down that if I wanted to be able to not just contribue but solve problem and bring the project to a better level, I needed to learn more about mobile development. I couldn't just be an average mobile developer, I needed to become a better one. And for that, I needed to keep learning, proactively!. 

And that's when As it was an existing project, I needed to learn how the project was done in the first place and how mobile development was done at Mirego in order to start contributing. This was what I needed to Because this was required learning for me to even start working, It was easy to learn on company time because it was part of my job.

But, I  I also needed to learn the particularities of how mobile development was done at my company, Mirego. Around the same time, I was promoted to the role of lead developer at Mirego. So, I decided to use the approach to learn how to improve my engineering leadership abilities. become a better engineering leader. The time coincided with my nomination as a lead developer at Mirego. So, I wanted to learn more on how to be a good engineering leader.   My first order of business was choosing how much time I should be spending on learning at work.

I used to spend 10 to 15 hours per week when I was learning on my own time. Obviously, I couldn't use the same amount at work because that would have impeded on my capacity to deliver. As I didn't any other base from which to decide what amount would be good for me, I decided to go with a learning tax of 10% of my weekly work hours which was 4 hours per week.

Because I used the pomodoro technique for my focus work, I ended up settling for two blocks of 25 minutes per day with a 5 minutes break between each block. This gave a grand total of 4 hours and 35 minutes per week, a 11.5% learning tax.
