  While searching for an approach to keep learning while working, I got the idea
  of making my employer or clients pay me a learning tax to get better at
  serving them. In this article, I share what I discovered by adopting this
  approach, the impact it had on projects I working on and the difficulties I
  ran into while using it.

This is the third article of the series [**How to keep learning while working**](/category/how-to-keep-learning-while-working/) in which I share how I learned to find the time, energy and focus necessary to learn new things while maintaining a good work-life balance.

Previous article â˜ž [**How to keep learning while working, Part 2: What experienced people taught me about learning on the job**](/how-to-keep-learning-while-working/what-experienced-people-taught-me-about-learning-on-the-job)

After learning what more experienced people around me were doing to keep getting better at their job while still spending quality with their friends and family, I realized that none of the tactics they shared with me really fitted what I was looking for. I was gutted and decided to stick to learning entirely on my own time as I used to do even if that meant I needed to make some sacrifices on my work-life balance.

Then one day, I got an unsuspected idea while filing my taxes. We give the government part of our hard earned money to allow it to make our life better by building infrastructures and services that would benefit us and potentially help us make even more money.

As the government serves me, I serve my employer and its clients. What if my employer paid me a learning tax to better serve them just like I pay tax to the government for it to better serve me ? As an idea, this was really a stretch one. There is a big difference between my relation to the government and the one to my employer. But I liked the idea because it seemed to me like a better version of working on company time. So I decided to try it out.

## What is the learning tax approach ?

The learning tax approach is a more restricted version of the learning on company time approach that we saw in the previous article. In essence, they both implies using some amount of your work hours to learn. But, in opposite to the learning on company time approach, the learning tax approach restricts the amount of time one can use for learning and limits the learning contents to only those subjects which can bring value to the company. 

## Who is this approach for ?

The learning tax approach works well for people who are looking to learn proactively but find it difficult to learn on their personal time and their job contents rarely give them opportunities for proactive learning.

## How does it work ?

To implement the learning tax approach, you need to careful choose what you are going to learn and how much time you will spend on it.

### Choosing what to learn

The learning tax approach requires that the subjects learned have a potential to bring value to the company down the road. So when choosing what to learn, it is important to select only those subjects whose value can be demonstrated to the employer. This helps make taking time to learn a clear win-win situation for both the employer and the employee.

### Choosing how much time to spend on learning

This will depend on what you are learning, your employer and your work hours. The rule of thumb is it should be a reasonable amount that won't make your employer cringe and the take time taken should not impede on your ability to deliver projects on time.

## How did it work out for me ?
