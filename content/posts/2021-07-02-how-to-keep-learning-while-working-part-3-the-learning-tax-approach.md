  While searching for an approach to keep learning while working, I got the idea
  of making my employer or clients pay me a learning tax to get better at
  serving them. In this article, I share what I discovered by adopting this
  approach, the impact it had on projects I working on and the difficulties I
  ran into while using it.

This is the third article of the series [**How to keep learning while working**](/category/how-to-keep-learning-while-working/) in which I share how I learned to find the time, energy and focus necessary to learn new things while maintaining a good work-life balance.

Previous article â˜ž [**How to keep learning while working, Part 2: What experienced people taught me about learning on the job**](/how-to-keep-learning-while-working/what-experienced-people-taught-me-about-learning-on-the-job)

After learning what more experience people around me were doing to keep getting better at their job while still spending quality with their friends and family, I realized that none of the tactics they shared with me really fitted what I was looking for. I was gutted and decided to stick to learning entirely on my own time as I used to do even if that meant I needed to make some sacrifices on my work-life balance.

Then one day, I got an unsuspected idea while filing my taxes. We give the government part of our hard earned money to allow it to make our life better by building infrastructures and services that would benefit us and potentially help us make even more money.

As the government serves me, I serve my employer and its clients. What if my employer paid me a learning tax to better serve them just like I pay tax to the government for it to better serve me ? As an idea, this was really a stretch one. There is a big difference between my relation to the government and the one to my employer. But I liked the idea because it seemed to me like a better version of working on company time. So I decided to try it out.

## The learning tax approach

The learning tax approach involves spending a fixed amount of company time on learning that has a potential to make you better at your current work or a potential to improve what you are currently working on.

The learning tax approach differs from just taking your company time in two aspects:

1. The amount taken is fixed: You should commit to just fixed amount of learning per week. You can use less but never more than the fixed amount unless it is required by the job you are currently doing. This helps make it more acceptable to employers than just taking company time because it increases predictability.
2. The learning content is restricted:

Well, for starters, 

Before trying the learning tax approach, I needed to define it. What did I want it to look like ? What did I want to accomplish with it ?

The definition of the learning tax approach was simple: Taking some time out of your work hours to learn things that can make you better at serving your employer.
