This is the third article of the series **[How to keep learning while working](/category/how-to-keep-learning-while-working/)** in which I share how I learned to find the time, energy and focus necessary to learn new things while maintaining a good work-life balance.

Previous article â˜ž **[How to keep learning while working, Part 2: What experienced people taught me about learning on the job](/how-to-keep-learning-while-working/what-experienced-people-taught-me-about-learning-on-the-job)**

In late 2019, the project I was working on needed a new lead mobile developer as the previous lead moved on to another project. At that point, the only experience I had as a mobile developer was a two months stint two years before. Nevertheless, I decided to take on the challenge because it was an urgent need for our project. 

Although my employer at the time gave me plenty of time to onboard and get used to the technicalities of the project, I knew it wouldn't be enough to make me an excellent mobile developer. I needed to learn and practice more to get to that point.

Fortunately, my all around knowledge of software development helped me get up to speed faster. I wasn't yet a good mobile developer but I was already contributing to the project after a month or so.

However, just contributing wasn't what I wanted. I pride myself in trying to be excellent in whatever I do. So, I needed to be not just a good contributor but an excellent one. And to become excellent, I needed to keep learning while doing the job. This was the perfect opportunity to test my new learning tax approach I talked about at the end of the previous article.

## What is the learning tax approach ?

In the previous article of this series, we showed three main approaches to learn while working: Learning by experience only, Learning on personal time and Learning on company time.

For me, learning on company time was the ideal approach given my personal situation. I wanted to spend as much time as I could with my family and spend time working on my side project while continuing to learn and grow in my career. The only problem was that I felt like using company time to learn instead of delivering value wasn't fair to my employer. 

In fact,  I have seen so many instances where someone on the team took a lot of time on his own to learn something that wasn't required for the project at hands and ended up being unable to deliver on their tasks. This would always draw frustration from the project manager and other team members because it was usually perceived as wasted time and budget.

With the learning tax approach, I wanted to make learning on company time fairer for my employer and also eliminate or reduce the perceived waste of time and budget from the project manager and other team members.

The learning tax approach is a more restricted version of using company time to learn. Instead of just taking any amount of time to learn any subject, employees should make sure that they can demonstrate clearly how whatever they choose to learn at any time have a potential to bring value to the their current project or to the company at large. They should also ensure that the amount of time they dedicate to learning is predictable from week to week and doesn't affect their capacity to deliver their tasks.

Using these restrictions when using company time to learn aim to make sure it's always a win-win for both the employees and the employer. Employees win because they don't have to sacrifice personal time to keep learning. And the employer wins because they can be sure that what employees are learning will likely bring them value in the near future.

## Using the learning tax approach

To use the learning tax approach, I needed to start by choosing the learning tax i.e how much time I would set aside for learning purposes. Choosing the right amount of time as a learning tax was key to the approach and it wasn't an easy task. I had to make sure the tax chosen was enough to learn at a good pace and at the same time, it didn't affect my ability to deliver my project assignments on time. 

I didn't have any data to help me decide how much time was the best option for me. So, I decided to go with the minimum block of time I could afford to use and that was a block of 25 minutes per day. If you are wondering why 25 minutes, it's because I use the pomodoro technique for my focused work which divide time in multiple 25 minutes blocks.

Twenty-five minutes per day meant my learning tax was only 5% of my weekly work hours. It wasn't a huge commitment. I was happy because the impact on my work was minimal! I was still delivering my tasks on time and at the same rate I used to before taking the 5% learning tax which was quite surprising for me.

Unfortunately, as time passed, I started to realize that 25 minutes wouldn't be enough to maintain a good learning pace. It didn't allow me keep up the pace with most of my online classes as I was always late on weekly assignments.

After analyzing all the lessons I had taken up to that point, I realized that doubling my learning tax would probably be the better option. However, I was afraid of the impact spending a half day on learning could have on my capacity to deliver on my project tasks. Nevertheless, I decided to try it anyway.

After just two weeks of increasing my learning tax to 50 minutes per day, it was evident that I had found my balance. It was a perfect mix. My colleagues could barely detect the change. I was still delivering on my promises and I had enough time to follow my online classes. For me, a learning tax of 10% happened to be my sweet spot.

## Does the learning tax approach work ?

I have been using the learning tax approach since January 2020. Since then, it has helped me learn a lot about both engineering and management. I have used the tax to become a better mobile developer and hone my leadership skills.

Yes, I still have some difficulties to use the full 4 hours per week of learning, especially when I work on intensive tasks. But for the most part, I have been able to learn and grow more since adopting this strategy.

Using the learning tax approach doesn't seem to have affected my ability to be productive. In opposite, I think it has even increased my productivity as I have learned through the months how to be more effective and do more in less time.\
\
Even if I had to be questioned one day by my employer about the tax, I have made sure that whatever I choose to learn using this approach, I can demonstrate how it could help the company or the project I am working on down the road.

So far, I have used my learning tax in classes, articles, lessons about active listening, empathy, technical leadership, engineering management, Mobile app performance, etc. And I'm really satisfied with the growth I have gained through these classes.

I intend to keep using the learning tax approach to keep getting better at whatever job I'm doing. Today, my child being a little bit grown up, I also manage to use 25 minutes of personal time each morning to learn things that may not have a direct impact on my job. The combination of this and the learning tax approach has allowed me to reach a level of learning I'm really satisfied with. Now, I feel like I'm learning something new everyday and I'm enjoying it. And I can see the repercussion of all this both in my professional and personal life.

## Want to try the learning tax approach ?

If you are looking to learn proactively to get better at your job but find it difficult to learn on your personal time, I would suggest you to give this learning tax approach a try. It's really simple to set up and get going. You just need to chose two things:

1. How much time you'll dedicate to learning: Make sure you some fare amount. I would suggest choosing an amount that allows you to have a good pace without affecting your capacity to deliver. If you are having a hard time finding that out, try 10%.
2. What to learn: In order to make sure your employer doesn't see you taking time to learn in a wrong way, make sure to choose to learn something that have a direct impact on what you are doing now or will be doing in a near feature. And make sure what you will get from learning has the potential to bring a lot of value to your employer. This way, it will be easier for you to justify taking the time if you are asked to do it one day.
