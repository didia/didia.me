  As professionals, we are expected to keep learning and adapt to the
  ever-changing needs of our environment and organizations. But with our work
  day already spent in full on our regular duties, how can we find the time,

  semblance of work life balance ?

I have always been someone who love learning. I thought myself to code and wrote my first website before attending my first programming class at school. While at school, I was always trying to learn more than what the teacher usually gave us. I would go on to read from multiple sources, search the internet, trying to find additional material that would give me an edge over the rest of my classmates.

There were days when I would remain at the office up until 11 in the evening working on side projects or taking a course online. When I was not spending times with friends on weekends, I would put a game of basketball on TV while working on a side project. I was always in a constant learning mode.
