  As professionals, we are expected to keep learning and adapt to the
  ever-changing needs of our environment and organizations. But with our work
  day already spent in full on our regular duties, how can we find the time,
  energy and focus required to learn new things while still maintaining a
  semblance of work life balance ?

I have always been someone who loves learning. I thought myself to code and built my first website before attending my first programming class at school. At school, I was always trying to learn more than what teachers were giving us. I would go on to read from multiple sources, browse through the internet in order to find additional materials that would give me an edge over the rest of my classmates. 

After finishing school, I brought that same love for learning at work. Yes, learning new things is fun but fun was not the reason why I did it. For me, learning has always been a necessity. It was our duties as professionals to spend that extra time to learn just like professional athletes spend time practising at the gym. Hence, I could not understand people who were telling me they did not have time to learn a new technology or work on side projects to acquire new skills.

When I started working full time in January 2017,  my girlfriend was still living miles away from me in Russia. That allowed me to spend time after work to keep learning. There were days when I would remain at the office up until 11 p.m just working on some side projects or attending an online course. And on weekends, when I was not spending times with friends, I would continue working on a side project while watching a game of basketball. I was always in a constant learning mode. For me, that was the only way to maintain a high level on my profession. 

\- The wall

In September 2017, my girlfriend and I got married and one year later, we started living together. From then on, things started changing for me. 

First to go were the late nights at the office. Obviously with my wife at home, I could not afford to stay that late at the office. Nevertheless, I still had the time to keep learning after my wife would go to bed. It was not the same amount of learning as before but it was more than enough to keep me up-to-date on new development in my field. But things were about to get a lot harder than that.

In May 2019, we welcomed a third member of our small family. People already warned me that raising a kid is a full time job on its own. But I did not grasp the full extent of that. With my son in the mix, it was now really hard to find time to keep learning outside of work, even on weekends. All my projects were put to rest. I stopped taking online classes and basically for the next 3 months or so, I did not learn something new on my own time. Now I was starting to understand what people told when they said they did not have time to work on side projects or to learn after work. Life happened. 

Obviously, for someone who see learning as a necessity, that situation bordered me. I was afraid my career would stall while I still had so much room to learn and grow. I could not let that happen. It was not an option. I was sure there was a way to make it work. I mean there are a lot of people with both successful careers and successful family. How do they do it ?

\- The new opportunity

To find a solution to my problems, I first went to talk to people who had more work experience than me and also had a large family to attend. I asked them how they found time to learn while still having a great work-life balance.
