  As professionals, we are expected to keep learning and adapt to the
  ever-changing needs of our environment and organizations. But with our work
  day already spent in full on our regular duties, how can we find the time,
  energy and focus required to learn new things while still maintaining a
  semblance of work life balance ?

I have always been someone who love learning. I thought myself to code and wrote my first website before attending my first programming class at school. While at school, I was always trying to learn more than what the teacher usually gave us. I would go on to read from multiple sources, search the internet, trying to find additional material that would give me an edge over the rest of my classmates. 

After finishing school, I brought that same love for learning at work. For me, learning was not just something I did because I loved it, it was not a passion, it was a necessity. Hence, I could not understand when people with more experience told me they did not have time to learn a new technology or work on side projects to hone their skills. I could not understand it. I always thought that as professionals, it was our duties to spend that extra time to keep learning, just like professional athletes spend time practising at the gym. 

Back in 2017, when I was still new in the job market and my girlfriend was still living miles away from me in Russia, I used late nights at the office to keep learning. There were days when I would remain at the office up until 11 in the evening working on side projects or taking a course online. When I was not spending times with friends on weekends, I would put a game of basketball on TV while working on a side project. I was always in a constant learning mode.

But in September 2017, my girlfriend and I got married and one year later, she was done with school in Russia and moved in with me in Canada. From then on, things started changing for me. 

First to go were the late nights at the office. Obviously with my wife at home, I could not do them anymore. Nevertheless, I still have the time to keep learning after my wife would go to bed. Yes, it was not the same amount of time anymore but it was more than enough to work on side projects.

Then in May 2019, we welcomed a third member in our small family. The arrival of our  son would create even more changes than I initially expected. It was now very hard to find time to keep learning at home after work, even on the weekends. All my side projects were put to rest. Suddenly, I could understand now why my experienced colleagues had difficulties working on side projects or learning after work: They had a life.

For the first time in my work lifetime, I would go on for more than 3 months without learning something new outside of what I was working on at the office. Well, I did learn a lot about parenting during those times but professionally, I stalled. I did not like that feeling one bit. At that stage of my career, stalling was not an option. I had still so much to learn and grow that I had to find a way. So I went back to some colleagues with family and more experience to find out how they do it.
