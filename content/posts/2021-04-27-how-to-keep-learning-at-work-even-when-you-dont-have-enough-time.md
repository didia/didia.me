  As professionals, we are expected to keep learning and adapt to the
  ever-changing needs of our environment and organizations. But with our work
  day already spent entirely on our regular duties, how can we find the time,
  energy and focus required to learn new things while still maintaining a
  semblance of work life balance ?

I have always been someone who loves learning. Like many people, I thought myself to code and built my first website before attending my first programming class at school. While at school, I was always trying to learn more than what teachers were giving us. I would go on to read from multiple sources, browse the internet in order to find additional materials that would give me an edge over the rest of my classmates. 

After finishing school, I brought that same mentality to work. Yes, learning new things is always fun but that was not the reason why I did it. For me, learning has always been a necessity. I thought it was our duties as professionals to spend that extra time to learn just like professional athletes spend time practising at the gym. That is why I could not understand people who were telling me they did not have time to learn a new technology or work on side projects to acquire new skills.

When I started working full time in January 2017,  my then girlfriend now wife was still competing his studies miles away from me in Russia. That allowed me to spend more time learning after work. There were days when I would remain at the office up until 11 p.m to work on some side projects or to follow an online course. Even on weekends, when I was not spending time with friends, I would work on a side project while watching a game of basketball. I was always in a constant learning mode. For me, that was the only way to remain at the top of my game.

But things started changing for me in July 2018. My wife was done with school and joined me in Canada. As we started leaving together, I needed to make some changes to the routine I had while leaving alone.

First to go were the late nights at the office. Obviously with my wife at home, I could not afford to stay that late at the office. Then, I needed to cut back on the amount of hours I spend working on the weekends which were basically the same as on weekdays. No need to say that these changes greatly impacted the time I spent learning outside of work. Nevertheless, I could still find some time here and there that was more than enough for me to keep up with new development in my field. And when I needed focused time to work on an online class, I would take 1 or 2 hours on the weekends to do it. But things were about to get a lot harder than that.

In May 2019, we welcomed a third member of our small family. People already warned me that raising a kid was a full time job on its own. But I did not grasp the full extent of that. With my son in the mix, it got extremely hard to find time to keep learning outside of work, even on weekends. All my projects were put to rest. I stopped taking online classes and basically for the next 3 months or so that followed, I did not learn anything new outside of work. Now I was starting to understand what people meant when they said they did not have time to work on side projects or to learn after work: Life happened.

For someone like me, who has always considered learning as a necessity, it was a tough pill to swallow. I feared that my career would stall while I still had so much room to grow. I could not let that happen. It was not an option. I had to find a way to make it work. I mean there are a lot of people with both successful careers and successful family. How did they make it work ? I had to find out. So I went and asked around.

The first people I reached out to were colleagues who had more experience than I and who had a family to attend to. I asked them how they found time to keep learning while maintaining a good work-life balance. The answers I got were surprising, insightful and it led me to my first insight on how I could possibly make it work. That is what I am going to share with you in the next article of this series of articles on how to keep learning at work even when you don't have enough time.

Until next time,
